# Practical Lab Assignment - Control Structures - if/else

1. C++ program that converts between Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures based on user input. You can also add conversions for Kelvin.
2. C++ Program to Check Whether a Number is Even or Odd.
3. C++ Program to Check Whether a Number is Positive or Negative.
4. C++ Program to Check Whether a Character is a Vowel or Consonant.
5. C++ Program to find the Largest Number Among Three Numbers.
6. C++ Program to find if the entered year is a leap year or not.
7. C++ program that allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two numbers. You can also add error handling for division by zero.
8. BMI Calculator: Create a program that calculates a person's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight and height input. Provide a classification of whether the person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. Use cin, cout.
    Formula: bmi = weight / (height * height)
    
    | bmi < 18.5 | Underweight |
    | --- | --- |
    | bmi < 24.9 | Normal Weight |
    | bmi < 29.9 | Overweight |
    | Otherwise | Obese |
9. Nested condition
    - Get the `age` and `membership_status` as user input. `membership_status` can be only `Y` or `y`. So, if the age is bigger or equal to 18 and if the user is a member of our shop, we provide a 10% discount, else we charge fully. 
    - Write a simple chatbot program using nested conditions.
10. Write a program to calculate taxes, with the following conditions:
    - If the salary is less than $1500, then there are no taxes
    - If the salary is from 1501 to 3000 $ (1501<= salary < 3000) then the tax should be 10%
    - If the salary is from 3001 to 5000 $ (3001 <= salary < 5000) then the tax should be 20%
    - If the salary is above $5000, then the tax should be 30%
    
    **Hint: Formula for finding tax (salary * percentage) / 100**
    
    You must output:
    - Tax percentage
    - Salary after taxes
11. Switch
    - Program to use `switch` statement. Display Monday to Sunday.
    - Program to display arithmetic operator using switch case.
12. C++ Program to Find all Roots of a Quadratic equation.
13. C++ Program to Check Whether a Character is an Alphabet or not.
